 * A characteristic quality or distinctive feature of a ProductSpecification.  The characteristic can be take on a discrete value, such as color, can take on a range of values, (for example, sensitivity of 100-240 mV), or can be derived from a formula (for example, usage time (hrs) = 30 - talk time *3). Certain characteristics, such as color, may be configured during the ordering or some other process.
