/**
 * The billing account receives all charges (recurring, one time and usage) of the offers and products assigned to it during order process. Periodically according to billing cycle specifications attached to the billing account or as a result of an event, a customer bill (aka invoice) is produced. This customer bill concerns different related parties which play a role on it : for example, a customer bill is produced by an operator, is sent to a bill receiver and has to be paid by a payer. A payment method could be assigned to the customer bill to build the call of payment. Lettering process enables to assign automatically or manually incoming amount from payments to customer bills (payment items). A tax item is created for each tax rate used in the customer bill.
