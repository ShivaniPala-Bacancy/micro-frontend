 * **TMF API Reference : TMF 622 - Product Ordering Management**  **Release : 19.0 - June 2019**  The Product Ordering API provides a standardized mechanism for placing a product order with all of the necessary order parameters. The API consists of a simple set of operations that interact with CRM/Order Negotiation systems in a consistent manner. A product order is created based on a product offer that is defined in a catalog. The product offer identifies the product or set of products that are available to a customer, and includes characteristics such as pricing, product options and market. This API provide a task based resource to request order cancellation.  The product order references the product offer and identifies any specific requests made by the customer.  **Product Order resource** A Product Order is a type of order which can be used to place an order between a customer and a service provider or between a service provider and a partner and vice versa.
